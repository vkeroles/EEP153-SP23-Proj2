# Project 2 Subsistence Diets (Team Justus von Liebig)

Every living human has some minimal, or subsistence, nutritional requirements; should these not be satisfied health and even life may be threatened. People satisfy these needs by eating various kinds of food, but there may be many different food diets which satisfy people’s subsistence requirements. One criterion for choosing among these diets is cost.

In this topic students use contemporary data on different kinds of foods available to the US population along with prices to construct estimates of minimum cost subsistence diets.
